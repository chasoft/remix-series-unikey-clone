### UniKey Vietnamese Input Method

* In 2001, I released the source code of the core engine UniKey Vietnamese Input Method together with the x-unikey linux package. Since then, the UniKey engine has been integrated to different keyboard input programs in various platforms: Linux, [macOS and iOS](/), FreeBSD. The core engine is still pretty much unchanged in the latest version of UniKey for Windows. You can get the engine source code in the original x-unikey linux package.

* For educational purposes, I have also released the full UniKey 3.6 (for Windows) source code. Please note that, UniKey 3.6was built with an old version of the UniKey Input Engine. You cand find the latest engine source code in the x-unikey package above.
